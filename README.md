Find randomly generated secret number using Python

This is sample python program, we have to find the secret code generated randomly from the system, to find the secreat code we are giving the clues. clues will say the match or close,

let say secret key is 561

if I enter 513, then you will get output as ```match, close```.

it means we placed 5 as correct number and then 3 is there is the secret code but placing is wrong. now i will 531, then I will get ```close,close```, so now I have to guess the 3rd number to solve the puzzle.
